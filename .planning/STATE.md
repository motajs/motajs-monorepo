# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-20)

**Core value:** Decouple the editor kernel from engine details through an engine-agnostic `editor-core` so old and new engines share one editing layer and third parties can customise freely.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — Baseline & Verification Net

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (Baseline & Verification Net) — EXECUTING
Plan: 4 of 7
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-09-20 — Phase 01 execution started

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 12-phase structure adopted — verification net first, then boundary, kernel, verbatim resource/edit moves, adapter skeleton, shell, capabilities least-coupled-first (table→code→asset→map), preview/cutover, then extension freeze + parity gate.
- [Roadmap]: `editor-core` package uses `lib/` (never `src/`) per `resolvePlugin.js` and `tsconfig.lib.base.json`; subpath exports (`.`, `./code`, `./table`, `./map`, `./asset`, `./shell`, `./react`) created up front.
- [Roadmap]: Per-instance `EditorCore` via `createEditorCore(config)` replaces the six module singletons; registration returns diagnostics+rollback, construction fails loudly on unresolved required registration.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 8 (Code) needs the Blockly split confirmed before planning; Phase 10 (Map) and Phase 11 (Preview/cutover) are flagged for phase-specific research.
- Phase 7 (Table) has an open design question: built-in primitive field types vs engine-supplied, and whether the field-editor registry is core-mechanism or fully adapter-provided.
- Phase 2 carries two MEDIUM-confidence open items (PandaCSS `include` across the package boundary, React Compiler coverage of `packages/libs/**`) — budget spikes, not research phases.
